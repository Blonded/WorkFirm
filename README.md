# WorkFirm
WorkFirm is a Java program for employees, demonstrating Polymorphism.
This is an organized, simplistic backend designed system to display employees personal information placed within the company, as well as a computed amount of hours worked, vacation hours, volunteer status, and their level of business (ie: executive).

# How to use WorkFirm
Clone the WorkFirm file to your laptop from Github, when it has successfully downloaded open your terminal and navigate to the src folder. 
In the terminal check the java version as this program runs best on java 1.8 (When I created the application this was a requirement.)
Check the version by typing into your command line: java -version
To convert to java 1.8 simply type on your command line: export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`
Thereafter, navigate to the src file, when you're inside the src file type: javac Firm.java 
Then: java Firm

This will compile and trigger the 'driver program' of WorkFirm and should seamlessly display the employees personal information registered throughout the app.

Ta Da!
